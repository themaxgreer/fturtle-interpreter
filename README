Description:
fturtle is a program that after being put through a lexical analyzer and 
parsed, runs a main function that interprets the commands in the .turtle file
to create a turtle graphics image.

make clean

To Run enter this command:
./fturtle < $(turtle name).turtle | ./turtle.pl | convert pgm:- $(turtle name).png
-where turtle name is one of the examples in the examples folder, i.e. circle.turtle

Dependencies (What you need to run): flex, bison, imagemagick

What will be outputted from the run command:
an image matching the interpretted .turtle file


Thanks to:
Dr. Cochran (ezekiel.vancouver.wsu.edu) for the base yacc/bison grammar and 
lex/flex spec and the perl script to handle image creation.

Note: I made everything into expressions including built-in functions and user defined functions.
I treated them all as being part of the CallExpr class where I evaluate the arguments passed to
the function. The only output that is messed up is when you interpret star.turtle, I assume it is
due to the pendown function taking an argument of false and I am still outputting D due to it 
being part of my built-in functions.
